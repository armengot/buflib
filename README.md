# Block-based Union Find (BUF)

This Connected Components Labeling (CCL) algorithm was shown as a GPU optimization solution introducing a block-based approach in the paper referenced:

S. Allegretti, F. Bolelli and C. Grana, "*Optimized Block-Based Algorithms to Label Connected Components on GPUs*" in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, vol. 31, no. 2, pp. 423-438, 1 Feb. 2020, doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2019.2934683.

## API

Just like done in the [cudalabel](https://github.com/armengot/cudalabel) repo, the CCL/BUF algorithm is tested here to obtain connected components at record speed, processed on the GPU.

The code downloaded from the [YACCLAB](https://github.com/prittt/YACCLAB) repo is placed here in the **bufcore.cu** file (copied&pasted), and a C++ wrapper class has been added, to which I have incorporated the extraction of bounding boxes.

## Usage

As simple as seen before:

```
cv::cuda::GpuMat img,glabels;
cv::Mat labels;
bufapi b;

// BUF api usage
b.img(img);    
glabels = b.getlabels();    
glabels.download(labels);    

// getting bounding boxes
std::vector<cv::Rect> boxes = b.getboxes();
```

## Times

GOAL: The whole 4k (RGB) image must be processed in less than 33.33ms if the total video rate must be around 30FPS.

Allegretti et al. provide us with an algorithm to obtain the labeled image in the range of 0â€“1 ms; my added layer for extracting the bounding boxes is not as efficient, but overall it does not exceed the required maximum.
